# Canards Processor Board Firmware
Firmware for the 2024-2025 processor board, performing state estimation and control for the canards system. Project documentation can be found in the team Google Drive.

## Project Structure
- `src/drivers/`: custom peripheral driver modules
- `src/application/`: high-level application logic modules
- `src/third_party/`: third-party libraries
- `src/common/`: shared resources specific to this project
- `tests/`: everything for [testing](#Unit-Testing)
- Everything else is autogenerated by STM32CubeIDE with few modifications

## Developer Setup
This project is not dependent on STM32CubeIDE.
Code editing, unit testing, and building should be done in the devcontainer.
Only running/debugging on target should be done in STM32CubeIDE.

#### 1. Clone repo
- Clone repo and initialize submodules: ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/waterloo-rocketry/cansw_processor_canards ```
   - (Note: if you choose to clone with ssh instead, you have to manually setup ssh forwarding in the devcontainer.)

#### 2. Open project in devcontainer
The devcontainer has everything setup for editing, unit testing, and building. Most dev work should occur in it.
- Open the project using vscode devcontainers.
  - [Install devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)
  - In a new vscode window, use `Ctrl+Shift+P`, search `Dev Containers: Open Folder In Container...`, then select this project folder
    - The first time opening the project will take several minutes to build the devcontainer. Subsequent times will be instant.

#### 3. Build and test project in devcontainer
*Recommended: use vscode cmake plugin:*
- Open the CMake plugin tab from the sidebar
- Under `Configure`, select which build type you want
- Hover over `Build`, click the build icon to build the configuration
  - The build preset should automatically be selected (eg, `Build Firmware (Debug) preset`)

#### 4. Run/debug in STM32CubeIDE
STM32CubeIDE is required for flashing/debugging on hardware. NOTE: STM32CubeIDE is not able to *build* this project. STM32CubeIDE is only used to *flash* the build from step 3.
- Import the project into STM32CubeIDE (version 1.16.1 recommended): `File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace`
- Build the project firmware binary using vscode (step 3)
- Use an ST-Link programmer to connect to processor board.
- Use STM32CubeIDE launch/debug as usual
  - NOTE: since the project can't be built in STM32CubeIDE, auto-building before launch is turned off. **Remember to always build the project after making edits.**

## Unit Testing
We use GoogleTest and Fake Function Framework (fff) for unit testing. All testing-related files are in `tests/`.
- Tests are built from `tests/CMakeLists.txt` which is separate from the project's main build config. Building and running tests is done via cmake.
- Test source code should be written in `tests/unit/`.
- Mocks should be made with fff in `tests/mocks/`.

### Add a test
- Add a new test group file in `tests/unit/`. See `test_dummy.cpp` for example of test structure.
- Add the test group to the cmake build system by editing `tests/CMakeLists.txt`:
  - At the bottom of the file, add the new test group using the `add_test_group()` helper.
    (Read the comments + existing examples explaining how it works)

### Add a mock
We do not include the STM32 HAL library nor FreeRTOS when compiling the project for unit tests.
So if a source file uses a HAL or FreeRTOS file, those files and their functions must be mocked using fff.
This works similarly for mocking other proc modules that a test interacts with but doesn't test.

Example 1:
- `src/drivers/gpio/gpio.c` uses FreeRTOS semaphores via `#include "semphr.h`.
  - In the actual firmware, the real `semphr.h` is included when compiling. But for unit tests, the real `semphr.h` is not included when compiling. So, the unit tests fail to compile (it can't find a `semphr.h` file).
    - To correct this we add a "fake" `semphr.h` in `tests/mocks/semphr.h`. All files in this folder are included when compiling unit test, so the tests now compile.
  - The gpio code uses functions from the real `semphr.h` like `xSemaphoreTake()`. These don't exist in our fake `semphr.h` yet.
    - To correct this we need to create a mock `xSemaphoreTake()` function using fff.
      [fff's Readme](https://github.com/meekrosoft/fff?tab=readme-ov-file#hello-fake-world) describes how to create fake functions. Here's the mock for `xSemaphoreTake()`:
      ```
      // The func to mock: BaseType_t xSemaphoreTake(SemaphoreHandle_t arg0, TickType_t arg1)
      
      DECLARE_FAKE_VALUE_FUNC(BaseType_t, xSemaphoreTake, SemaphoreHandle_t, TickType_t);
      ```
      First we put the *declaration* (`DECLARE_FAKE...`) in `mocks/semphr.h`. Then, put the actual *definition* (`DEFINE_FAKE...`) in the corresponding `mocks/semphr.c`.
- Now in the gpio tests, we can access the mocked semaphore functions via fff to test that the gpio code uses semaphores correctly.

Example 2:
- `src/application/estimator/estimator.c` takes input from flightphase via `#include "application/flight_phase/flight_phase.h`.
  - To test estimator, we will test various inputs from flightphase. But we don't want to be testing flightphase at the same time.
    So, mock flightphase.
  - The real `flight_phase.h` header is built in unit tests, but the source file `flight_phase.c` is not.
    - Since a function *declaration* for `get_flight_phase()` exists in the header, we can use fff's `DEFINE_FAKE...` to create a
      fake *definition* of that `get_flight_phase()`. That definition should be in the test .cpp file, or in the mocks folder if it's applicable for wider use.
    - (Note: unlike example 1 where the header isn't included in unit tests, the flightphase header is included so it doesnt need a `DECLARE_FAKE...`)

### Run/debug tests
- Build in vscode using cmake (see step 3 above)
  - The default `Build Unit Tests With Coverage preset` also automatically runs all tests and generates coverage report.
  - View the coverage report html pages in `build/test/coverage_report` in a local browser
- Use the vscode cmake `Launch` and `Debug` tabs to run/debug individual test groups (cmake shows the available test groups)


## Debugging on hardware
- Use STM32CubeIDE debugging as directed above
- The ST-link programmer has a serial output so you can listen to uart4 from a laptop COM port. The printf library (NOT THE STDLIB PRINTF) is configured to print strings to that COM port. Use `printf_("string to print..")` - note the `_` character.
  - This should rarely be used. Please instead learn how to use the debugger (breakpoints, dynamic print breakpoints, step, etc) for efficient and pleasant debugging.

## Code Standards
This project follows the [team-wide embedded coding standard](https://docs.waterloorocketry.com/general/standards/embedded-coding-standard.html).
- The devcontainer sets up vscode format-on-save to automatically use the team's clang-format.
  - In case you want to format manually, the script can be run from the project root directory:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/format.sh
  ```

- Rocketlib is included at `src/third_party/rocketlib`.
- Developers should be aware of the BARR Standard and make an effort to follow it.

## Notes
